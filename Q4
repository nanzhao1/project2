# remarks on results:
# As n grows larger, the individual success probabilities of strategy 1 and 3 approach 0.5, while that of strategy 2 approaches 0.38.
# The event that the prisoner find their number is identically and independently with success probability p.
# The strategy 2, counterintuitively, the probability of the event that the individual find the number in 2*n boxes by n trials is not converging to 0.5.
# Under the circumstances that the prisoner K open the box J containing the card J, the prisoner could never find the card K in strategy 2, which results in a lower probability.
# The event that all the prisoners, simultaneously, find their number in one experiment follows the distribution of binomial (100, p). The consequent success probability if p^100, which is close to 0.
# When n is large enough, the joint success probabilities of strategy 2 and strategy 3 are approaching 0. 
# When n is large enough, counterintuitively, the joint success probabilities of strategy 1 is approximating to 0.3 instead of 0.
# The strategy 1 turns out an effective way to succeed, as the joint success probability boosts.
# In strategy 1, if one prisoner fails, then there will a lot of other prisoners fail. While one prisoner succeeds, the other prisoners consequently succeed as well.
# That is, the prisoners tend to succeed or fail in the meantime. The consequent joint success probability is high.
# It can be viewed as a compnent of circles. The elements in the same circle will succeed or fail simultaneously. Whenever the circle length is no longer than trial time, the prisoners can all succeed.
