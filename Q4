# remarks on results:
# As n grows larger, the individual success probabilities of strategy 1 and 3 approach 0.5, while the one of strategy 2 approach 0.38
# The event that the prisoner find their number is identically and independently with success probability p
# The strategy 2, counterintuitively, the probability of the event that the individual find the number in 2*n boxes by n trials is not convergent to 0.5
# Under the circumstances that the prisoner K open the box J containing the card J, the prisoner could never find the card K in strategy 2, which results in a lower probability
# The event that all the prisoners, simultaneously, find their number in one experiment follows the distribution of binomial (100, p)
# The consequent success probability if p^100, which is close to 0
# When n is enough big, the joint success probabilities of strategy 2 and strategy 3 are approximately approaching 0 
# When n is large enough, counterintuitively, the joint success probabilities of strategy 1 is approximating to 0.3 instead of 0
# The strategy 1 turns out an effective way to succeed
